      <p>Fig. 17 shows our IT world, coupled to incremental workflow,
        managed by streams of code. Visualization and understanding is
        done mostly through BI and AI/ML, analyzing streams and stores
        of information. Cloud companies scrape large swaths of the world
        wide web to understand and visualize via AI models, tilting at
        the massive stores and streams of data, while consuming insane
        amounts of compute, network, and storage <span class="citation" data-cites="strubell_energy_2019">(<a

        co-exist with and leverage BI and AI/ML tech, but I don‚Äôt focus
        on it much in this paper, as there are oodles of staff available
        to do just about any kind of magic. Granted, the lifestyle
        portrayed in Fig. 18 is pleasant, but it leads to complacency,
        as system understanding and overarching organization goals are
        secondary to the appeal of dopamine pings <span class="citation" data-cites="chec_what_2020">(<a
            href="#ref-chec_what_2020" role="doc-biblioref">Chec 2020</a>)</span>. I admit, I like the
        dopamine. It alleviates the grind with small wins. I‚Äôd like to
        flip the script around on agile: the customer doesn‚Äôt care what
        the overall goal of the organization is. Triggering all based on
        product is a mistake, particularly if your work as an
        organization is more important than an entertaining mobile app.

      <p>
        Imagine driving a car cross country, but only relying on stream
        analysis, as though you are driving through a visualization of
        movie or rendered Mandelbrot Set, unaware of the formula. <a href="#section-24">(üí†)</a> <a

        Through the car windows flows scenery of billboards selling
        shaving products, mixed in with desert, lakes, and trees. We
        could base the decision on where to drive and how to operate the
        vehicle by the stream of information flashing by the windows and
        coming in through the sensors. Perhaps a satellite of love
        correlates the position of the car constantly and tells you
        where to turn <span class="citation" data-cites="lou_reed_lou_2013">(<a href="#ref-lou_reed_lou_2013"
            role="doc-biblioref">Lou Reed 2013</a>)</span>. As time and
        technology progress, we get better equipment, better cameras,
        faster cars; we build models to correlate with the stream of
        data. Is that a tree or a lake? How does our software recognize
        it? What algorithm works best? As the car goes faster and the
        features going by get more complex, we are faced with needing
        more and more equipment to navigate, more satellites, deeper
        supply chains, and more complete structural models in the car

            2017</a>)</span>. With enough compute and machinery, we might
        even be able to characterize the feel of the dirt, the way it
        might erode in the wind, just by the massive amount of data
        gleaned in the trip and stored from other trips. At the same
        time, a map that shows the roads, gas stations, hotels, and
        towns is prudent to carry. A checklist for changing a flat tire,
        a list of things to pack, what to do if the car overheats, how
        to hitch a ride, five ways to overcome a psycho killer that
        gives you a ride‚Ä¶ all of this can fit in a small notebook <span class="citation"
          data-cites="rhino_talking_2019">(<a href="#ref-rhino_talking_2019" role="doc-biblioref">RHINO
            2019</a>)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="gawande_checklist_2010">(<a

      <p>Having real-time measurements of the trip can be helpful, but
        what happens when there is no connectivity? What does your
        organization really need to run? Do you have it mapped out? What
        do you do when something unexpected happens? What do you do if
        that apt command in your Dockerfile uses a repository that is
        AWOL? A map lets you do things like continue on foot, change
        cars, or find the APT repository. A territory perspective ties
        you in to your service providers. Maps help ensure resilience.
        Note that a car full of territory equipment might usually win
        the race, at least while all the upstream dependencies are in
        good working order, including that satellite of love, but this
        is a different topic than resilience and autonomy. The massive
        compute, sensors, and AI/ML kit that processes data from various
        aspects of the scrolling desert, approximates territory;
        however, it does this over the surface of the fractal, the
        movie, going for that statistical nudge in identifying the place
        on the map via the territory, without first agreeing on a map
        with the sponsors and stakeholders. A stream-only approach, that
        relies on third parties, cedes knowledge, because the knowledge
        is embedded in services and platforms that are often not useful
        if you change cars or decide to walk. The identified gullies and
        shorelines might be profitable, but where is your map that you
        can use to change cars or walk yourself? Autonomous vehicles
        take this to an extreme. A map is less important if you can‚Äôt
        even drive your own car or fix it, if everything is a
        subscription service, and you own nothing, and decide nothing
        besides which corporate-created show entertains you this evening
        as you peel plastic off of your meal, or what piece of the
        product you fix in this week‚Äôs sprint. You are reading this
        presentation via the machinery of modern stream work flows, and
        it truly is wonderful. I‚Äôm writing this on an OS with a Linux
        kernel at the base <span class="citation" data-cites="noauthor_linux_nodate">(<a
            href="#ref-noauthor_linux_nodate" role="doc-biblioref"><span>‚ÄúThe <span>Linux</span>
              <span>Kernel</span> <span>Archives</span>‚Äù</span> </a>)</span>.
        This kernel powers most of the cloud interests. I am not arguing
        that we need to abandon the territory perspective, which does
        require massive compute and centralized resources. I am arguing
        that authoring our own maps as individuals and organizations is
        crucial to resilience, and to be suspicious of stream-only
        views, regardless of the sophistication of the AI/ML.</p>
