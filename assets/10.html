      <p>
        If I try and relate meaning with a paragraph of text, it is open
        to interpretation. Smaller propositions, though, are easier to
        pin down. What are the atoms of the system that can be pinned
        down? <a href="#section-26">(🛂)</a></p>
      <h2 id="section-21">🌳 Knowledge</h2>
      <p>
        Knowledge needs to be in a form that helps the broadest set of
        knowledge workers. This implies knowledge is written. Written
        knowledge started civilization with the written word. The
        logistics of civilization are such that knowledge is required to
        be written <span class="citation" data-cites="schmandt-besserat_evolution_2014">(<a
            href="#ref-schmandt-besserat_evolution_2014" role="doc-biblioref">Schmandt-Besserat 2014</a>)</span>.</p>
      <h3 id="section-22">🥤 Crucial</h3>
      <p>
        We need to be able to show crucial knowledge as a priority.
        Streams can help with this by triggering views of the system
        when triples are embedded. In a quickly changing system that a
        team is involved in analyzing, focusing on the metrics of what
        is broken is important.</p>
      <h3 id="section-23">🗄️ Retain</h3>
      <p>
        We need to be able to retain knowledge for future, unforeseen
        views. The format for retaining re-usable knowledge will vary
        widely by the needs of the stakeholders and application. <span

        uses emoji triples. Emoji are tricky to deal with, as they can
        take many forms for the same looking emoji. <a href="#section-19">(🧠)</a> I standardize on the full emoji
        that
        has color on most platforms. Usually this means that there is a
        variation selector. <span class="citation" data-cites="codepoints_ufe0f_2023">(<a

      <h3 id="section-24">💠 The Mandelbrot Set</h3>
      <p>

      <div class="rightee">
        <figure>
          <img src="/images/Mandelbrot_sequence_new.gif" alt="Mandelbrot Set">
          <figcaption aria-hidden="true">Mandelbrot Set</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>
      Consider this formula:<br>

      <div class="emo_m">
        <span
          class="math display"><em>z</em><sub><em>n</em> + 1</sub> = <em>z</em><sub><em>n</em></sub><sup>2</sup> + <em>c</em></span>
      </div>
      <p>By iterating with complex numbers c, and colorful
        visualization of what doesn’t escape to infinity, we get the
        Mandelbrot Set <span class="citation" data-cites="josch_joschmandelbrot_zomb_2021">(<a
            href="#ref-josch_joschmandelbrot_zomb_2021" role="doc-biblioref">josch 2021</a>)</span>.</p>
      <p>No matter what kind of AI/ML machinery is pointed at the
        animated rendering of the Mandelbrot Set in Fig. 15, it is
        extremely unlikely it will arrive at the simple formula <span class="citation"
          data-cites="mittal_r_c_back_2015">(<a href="#ref-mittal_r_c_back_2015" role="doc-biblioref">Mittal
            2015</a>)</span>. We might be able to find profitable gullies
        and shorelines in the rendered fractal territory, but we will
        not discover the formula. We could spend a lifetime enjoying the
        beauty of the surface curves, but we would always be caught in
        the surface, unaware of the rule, the formula underneath the
        territory. The gap between the movie and the screenplay is much
        like the gap between the formula for the Mandelbrot Set and the
        rendered visual, but rather than humans bridging the gap and
        creating unique movies that separate the gap, machines express
        the formula. <a href="#section-7">(🎭️)</a></p>
