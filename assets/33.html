      <p>
        I am not a Pollyanna. I am aware that broader forces guide our
        direction, rather than humans simply deciding where they are,
        where they want to go, and planning a path towards that goal.

        career, I was asked to act as the internal implementation
        engineer on a document management system for a national
        consulting firm. I was supposed to give the all-clear for
        purchase from a technical perspective. The first attempt to
        install the software failed. The IT manager and I both thought
        this was a very bad sign. The vendor flew their best consultant
        out to resolve our concerns. He seemed quite competent. I
        shadowed him the whole time he was trying to install the
        software. At one point he threw his hands in the air in
        frustration and exclaimed, ‚ÄúJunk, boys, all junk!‚Äù. After a long
        evening, the software did finally run. The next day I went to
        the senior director of the company, and told him how the
        software wasn‚Äôt ready for us to rely on, and related the ‚ÄúJunk,
        boys, all junk!‚Äù quote. He explained that it was a done deal.
        Unless I had any huge issues, we needed to buy the software and
        install it. We did discuss what huge issues were if ‚ÄúJunk, boys,
        all junk!‚Äù wasn‚Äôt a deal breaker. The IT manager, my boss, would
        not fight the decision, even though he disagreed with it. I
        asked to be removed from the document management project, and
        worked on infrastructure automation for the deployments as we
        purchased more companies in our roll-up strategy of growth. A
        lot of people experienced much pain over the next few years
        trying to get the software to run correctly. We had one problem
        after another. I later fought with IT management and crew over
        the concept of latency and network architecture as they shifted
        from local instances of the software to centralized. The
        document management software was a two tier client/server app,
        and performed poorly over latent connections. Despite my
        complaints, despite many whiteboard sessions arguing bandwidth
        vs.¬†latency, we deployed it anyway, it failed, and we ended up
        using Citrix to resolve the latency issues. Both the latency and
        the quality issues of the software were tangible aspects to
        consider before making decisions, but the people caught up in
        the stream of day-to-day life and obligations were unable to
        break out. I could provide diagrams, documentation and
        anecdotes. I could push with exceedingly clear attention to
        requirements, but until the system failed and lost money,
        whatever political machinations were involved in the momentum of
        the product implementation would overrule any logic.

      <p>There is a similar problem on an individual level. We
        constantly overestimate our ability to consciously make rational
        decisions, while much of what we do is motivated by internal
        unconscious forces. <span class="citation" data-cites="mate_gabor_realm_2018">(<a

        powerful than the political and social forces we are swept away
        with. Advertisers leverage this from both angles. <span class="citation" data-cites="taylor_alan_don_2007">(<a

            role="doc-biblioref">Collins 2015</a>)</span> I have found in my
        personal experience, that keeping a journal with dreams,
        subjects, daily entries, and memories helps to scare up
        unconscious forces and aids me in seizing agency in my life, by
        repeatedly using the revealed map against my intended goals.

            role="doc-biblioref">Sinclair, Leon 1981</a>)</span> The process
        is similar to overcoming the director and IT manager‚Äôs fear of
        standing up to the political currents. If a map was
        collaboratively built of the goals, interests and value that the
        organization had, and been communicated, then it might have
        helped trust between the companies that had been acquired in the
        roll-up, and resolution of the issue with the document
        management system might have been possible. I also know from
        experience that changing course off of these currents is
        extremely difficult. Usually it is motivated by crisis. <span

        is all I have, though. This is my best idea for how to change
        things, either now, or if we are unable, after the system proves
        to be junk and we fail. Discouragingly, we seem to be moving
        away from owning maps and knowledge. We have our stream devices
        in our pockets and screens that entertain us, advise us, and
        bring us food. We‚Äôve moved to user stories that trigger
        incremental updates to systems week by week, and overall system
        cognition is downplayed in deference to black-box modeling owned
        by apex cloud interests. <span class="citation" data-cites="meadows_donella_systems_1977">(<a

        method of creating maps and tools that facilitate aspects of
        system resilience. The rest is up to you, but let me know if I
        can help. I‚Äôm all about this.
