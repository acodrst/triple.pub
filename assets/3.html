      <p>I discovered triples as I struggled to communicate about
        complicated systems with increasingly specialized engineers. I
        found that while I couldn’t find anybody who could answer
        questions about the overall system, it was relatively easy to
        establish small facts. As I tried to visualize the facts in an
        automated way, I realized that the bioinformatics field had
        tools that could help, and that my previous career success with
        data flow was related <span class="citation" data-cites="shannon_cytoscape_2003">(<a

            et al. 2003</a>)</span>. Triples decompose systems into small
        facts that can be easily established and collaborated on
        iteratively. The most famous example is the Gene Ontology, but
        the concept goes back to the 1800s <span class="citation" data-cites="the_go_consortium_go_2023">(<a

      <p>Fig. 4 illustrates the triple “monitor has_resolution
        1920X1080”. The subject is “monitor”, the predicate is
        “has_resolution”, and the object is “1920X1080”. <a href="#section-20">(⚛️)</a> Triples can be assembled as a
        graph
        to visualize a broader perspective. <a href="#section-6">(🗺️)</a> Let’s start with four sentence
        triples: “Tigers eat cats.”, “Cats eat rats.”, “Cats eat mice.”,
        and “Mice eat cheese.” The subject and objects are connected by
        “eat”. <a href="#section-15">(🔩)</a> Fig. 5 shows cheese
        flowing through mice to tigers. The graph can prompt questions,
        like “What does the rat eat?” or “If the cheese is poisoned,
        what animals might be affected?”. The fact that we don’t have
        anything for the rat to eat on the graph doesn’t invalidate the
        graph. We can add what the rat eats as we learn. Likewise, the
        fact that a mouse eats peanut butter doesn’t invalidate the fact
        that the mouse eats cheese. We can also do inference: the tiger
        might well be eating cheese via other animals, so if the cheese
        was poisoned, we could query the graph to see what animals would
        be affected. <a href="#section-60">(🕵️)</a> The important thing
        to notice is that these small facts can be added at any time to
        the model. We could add “tigers eat pigs” later on. This
        flexibility is a key feature of using triples for system
        analysis called the Open World Assumption <span class="citation" data-cites="bergman_open_2009">(<a

      <p>Breaking down meaning into triples works well to create maps,
        as they can be re-assembled and visualized. <a href="#section-23">(🗄️)</a> Key-value pairs, coupled with a
        timestamp, do not provide the same flexibility, as an external
        structure has to be laid down, either via a model or through
        interactive exploring at the time of analysis, so they can’t be
        stored in a meaningful way for re-use separate from the model or
        interaction. Triples are the smallest atom of meaning <span class="citation"
