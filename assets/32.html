      <p>
        I moved on to another law firm, which had a similar cycle of
        projects that my solution design skills worked well for;
        however, there are some cracks starting to show. There was no
        architecture team, and the meaning of engineering and design had
        degraded to quick vendor meetings and a few notes. I realized
        that we had documents we needed to keep for 30 years. The
        scenario I was focused on was if documents were corrupted or
        purposefully deleted and not discovered until after 30 days. <a href="#section-44">(üíæ)</a> Backup retention
        is complicated at a
        law firm because of discovery. If email and deleted files are
        only retained for 30 days by policy, then discovery is easier to
        comply with. The cognitive ability for somebody to include
        backup retention from a discovery perspective, backup retention
        from a critical files perspective, and offsite replication
        vs.¬†rotation, was stretched to the point that additional
        questions about backup retention of critical files were quickly
        brushed off. Believe me when I say that three pages of narrative
        about backup retention does no good either. I met over ten times
        over the course of a year to get a proper backup retention
        policy in place. It wasn‚Äôt until I escalated directly with
        stakeholders (Records), that I got traction. With the command of
        Records, I finally got the operations team to put in a fix;
        however, they couldn‚Äôt figure out how to make it permanent for
        more than a year, and I had to set a yearly notice on my
        calendar to remind them to add an extra backup for the specific
        files I was concerned with. I had no indication that after all
        of this fight, that it had sunk in with operations that we
        needed a broader policy to cover other files, and I had used up
        more than my allotted attention fighting for this one backup
        design requirement aspect. This experience inspired me to figure
        out how to break down requirements and design considerations in
        ways that stakeholders could understand. As an analyst, the
        problem is my problem, not the stakeholders‚Äô. Can we agree on
        small facts?</p>

        Triples</h3>
      <p>
        In addition to the increasing cognitive challenges for
        operations folks trying to shepherd design considerations, the
        level of documentation, even in its simplest form, was too much
        for most people to understand. I think that the worst part was
        the long narrative form. Work and associated design knowledge
        was being broken down, while I was building my analysis and
        collaboration skills up. More and more I would find that even
        engineering managers could only digest a couple sentences. There
        was a perception by management that long-form analysis documents
        were part of the old world. The new world was agile. When
        network, security, storage, and OS dependencies are stripped
        away, i.e.¬†all that remains are containers and cloud services,
        the scope gets narrow enough that the developers can just write
        the app, show it to users, and in a tightly coupled loop deliver
        and improve products without much engineering or architecture.
        The perceived freedom of agile is that there is constant
        progress, but in practice it comes from sacrificing system
        cognition by the humans participating in the agile workstreams.
        One project, though, changed my life again, just as
        significantly as the Rockwell project manager did at the
        previous law firm. I was put on a project to convert the public
        finance group from paper workflow to electronic. I needed
        something that captured the system in an abstract way that could
        be reviewed with the group. The default Visio model that looked
        best was Gane and Sarson. It had three symbols. It made more
        sense than UML. More importantly, it solved the biggest problem
        I had so far: an easy and understandable way to provide levels
        of different detail. Gane and Sarson is a data flow model (DFD).
        Information Technology, at root, deals with data flow. There are
        many other perspectives that formal enterprise architecture
        frameworks capture, but data flow is the lowest common
        denominator. I used it to analyze several systems since, at full
        detail, and it is quite flexible, particularly with some of the
        constraints and conventions I have added.</p>
      <p>In 2018 I moved on to a company that offered wellness
        programs and coaching to employers. We had an outsourced
        engineering and design team, located overseas, with product
        management handled locally. I was meant to bridge that gap. Much
        of the business workflow was spread through a cloud service that
        cost a lot of money, and there was a desire to untangle the
        systems from this service. The workflow was coded over time by
        many people, and it touched every aspect of their business. It
        was not documented. It was a perfect candidate for a DFD. I
        created a system-wide DFD. Upper management and stakeholders
        found the method helpful, but the problem was that it was
        difficult to match the velocity of the product and engineering
        teams. I did some research on how to increase velocity, found
        that triples could help, and pitched it to the company, but they
        said my ideas were too advanced for them, and in 2019 I was laid
        off. I then worked as a consultant for a public utility, where I
        applied my ideas to monitoring and infrastructure visualization.
        Again, though, my ideas were too advanced for them, and after
        roughly four months work over the year, my contract expired. I
        decided to refine my ideas and publish a solution description on
        triple system analysis with working examples.</p>
