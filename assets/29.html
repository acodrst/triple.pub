      <p>With data flow, process <code>6🔸6🔸⚗️🔸1</code> is a
        subprocess of <code>6🔸⚗️🔸6</code>. This can provide an
        org-wide view that is particularly useful for alarms. It would
        be possible to then zoom in on a multi-level graph, or hover for
        location information.</p>

      <h3 id="section-71">💦 Multi-level data flow</h3>
      <p>
        <span class="citation" data-cites="h9z_multi-level_nodate">(<a href="#ref-h9z_multi-level_nodate"
            role="doc-biblioref">The 💦
            demo site </a>)</span> is a proper Gane and Sarson multi-level
        style graph. This is discussed in <a href="#section-28">(⚖️)</a>. The large portion of why I did all
        of this work is I wanted a better way to collaborate and
        generate data flow diagrams. Personally, I find DFDs to be one
        of the most flexible models. It turns out, after years of
        looking at this, that the reason why they work so well is
        because of the graph theory behind Structured System Analysis.
        Really, most folks reading this document could take <a href="#section-71">(💦)</a> as-is, and start building
        out data
        flow models right away, with automatically generated diagrams.
        In addition, narrative could be layered over the top of the
        graph. I wish I had this years ago.

      <h3 id="section-72">📜 Collapsible lists</h3>

            role="doc-biblioref">The 📜

            2023</a>)</span>. It shows a hierarchy of propositions that can
        each be validated on their own, expanded, and clarified. Do we
        need to offset 1,500TW EEI? We should be able to evaluate the
        larger system to determine how much energy is going into the
        Earth system and how much is leaving. Taxonomies also facilitate
        the appropriate view, as only the interesting branch is
        expanded. If the unique node ID includes a taxonomy
        classification it becomes more difficult to adjust. The triples
        are in a taxonomy:
      </p>
      <p>☀️🔸⚗️🔸🗿🔹🏷️🔹Popular efforts lead to ecosystem
        collapse<br>
        ☀️🔸⚗️🔸🗿🔸⚡️🔹🏷️🔹Efforts require energy<br>
        ☀️🔸⚗️🔸🗿🔸⚡️🔸💯🔹🏷️🔹MEER low energy to scale<br>
        ☀️🔸⚗️🔸🗿🔸⏲️🔸💯🔹🏷️🔹MEER immediately addresses
        imbalance<br>
        ☀️🔸⚗️🔸🗿🔸⏲️🔹🏷️🔹Efforts require time</p>
      <p>Node ☀️🔸⚗️🔸🗿🔸⏲️🔸💯 depends on node ☀️🔸⚗️🔸🗿 that means
        ecosystem collapse. This makes it difficult to move things
        around as we gain new information. In this particular demo, the
        point was to show collapsible lists, which are a kind of
        taxonomy anyway, so this is fine.</p>
