      <h3 id="section-9">💡 Quick to understand</h3>
      <p>
        There should be a minimal number of symbols on the map, and they
        should require only a few minutes to learn. Data flow fits this
        with just six symbols: three for data flow direction and three
        for the nodes. This is one of the reasons why I prefer emoji, if
        possible. Text works, but as I show in <a href="#section-84">(🔠)</a>, it is harder to understand at a
        glance.</p>
      <h3 id="section-10">👁️ Stakeholder visibility</h3>
      <p>
        Different stakeholders have different needs for visualization.
        Triples facilitate this, as there are many ways to style the map
        in an automated way, redrawing and visualizing as needed <span class="citation"
          data-cites="graphviz_graphviz_2023">(<a href="#ref-graphviz_graphviz_2023" role="doc-biblioref">Graphviz
            2023</a>)</span>. Narrative can also be tailored and overlaid on
        top of the graph.</p>
      <h3 id="section-11">✏️ Easy to change</h3>
      <p>
        Modifications to the underlying data should automatically adjust
        existing maps, and should not require major adjustments to the
        schema.</p>
      <h2 id="section-12">☎️ Communication</h2>
      <p>
        Wade through the mind-numbing muck of a corporate “what’s wrong
        with our group” exercise, and you will usually end up with the
        top ranking advice that better communication is needed. It may
        seem fruitless to spend all that time arriving at that
        conclusion <strong><em>every two years</em></strong> like
        clockwork, but it is still a core problem. Let’s analyze what we
        mean by communication about systems in crisis. Mostly this
        involves representing and sharing the knowledge of who, what,
        when, how, where, and why with a two-way tight coupling with
        streams and meaning. <a href="#section-29">(🌊)</a> <a href="#section-19">(🧠)</a></p>
      <h3 id="section-13">📛 Who is participating?</h3>
      <p>
        Who are the people contributing to the model of the system? This
        needs to be traced for several requirements. It is the only real
        structural requirement, as it is key to collaboration and
        streams.</p>
      <h3 id="section-14">🧩 What are we doing? What are the
        pieces?</h3>
      <p>
        What are the pieces of the system being communicated about? What
        are we doing overall?</p>
      <h3 id="section-15">🔩 How do the pieces combine? How do we get
        there?</h3>
      <p>
        How do we describe how pieces are related? How do we get to a
        complete system?</p>
      <h3 id="section-16">🧭 Where are we going? Where are the
        interactions?</h3>
      <p>
        Where are the interactions we are concerned with in the system?
        This might be a logical or physical perspective. Where are we
        going overall?</p>
      <h3 id="section-17">📅 When are the interactions? When will we
        arrive?</h3>
      <p>
        Are there crucial times or dates associated with the
        interactions? When will we arrive at our goal?</p>
      <h3 id="section-18">❓️ Why are we doing this?</h3>
      <p>
        Triples are particularly good at establishing why, since they
        can be added at any point in the process, and with any type of
        connection or interaction. This doesn’t interfere with velocity,
        as triples can be attached to the issue and fix, much like a
        tag, but with an extra dimension. While it is true that most
        platforms offer notes, they usually don’t offer notes
        referencing a broader map of “why”.</p>
      <h2 id="section-19">🧠 Meaning</h2>
      <p>
        We need to communicate with agreed meaning in order to store and
        filter knowledge. Streams, which are often captured without
        known structure, need AI/ML via models, black box analysis based
        on standard schemas, or a human hunt and search method to
        shoehorn meaning on the stream. Triples are better at this,
        because they are simple enough to be deemed true or false, but
        can also be put together to form broader, re-usable knowledge.
        Triples are also extensible to formal knowledge structures with
        globally agreed-on meaning <span class="citation" data-cites="smith_space_2022">(<a href="#ref-smith_space_2022"
            role="doc-biblioref">Smith 2022</a>)</span> <span class="citation" data-cites="smith_obo_2007">(<a
            href="#ref-smith_obo_2007" role="doc-biblioref">Smith et al.
            2007</a>)</span>. There is no room for confusion about what is
        meant. If I am stuck in the rain and talking over an unstable
        connection, and I want to convey that I am in Portland, I might
        use a standard phonetic alphabet and say “Papa, Oscar, Romeo,
        Tango, Lima, Alfa, November, Delta” <span class="citation" data-cites="nato_nato_1956">(<a
            href="#ref-nato_nato_1956" role="doc-biblioref">NATO 1956</a>)</span>. The phonetic
        alphabet has agreed-on meaning, and is designed so that when
        transmitted over a stream (radiotelephone), there is a low
        possibility for confusion over similarly sounding words. Meaning
        should be quickly established with visual queues when
        possible.</p>
      <p>There are several reasons why I conclude that emoji are
        useful for system analysis:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Immediately recognizable <a href="#section-9">(💡)</a></li>
        <li>Compact</li>
        <li>They work well in a graph as a visual node label <a href="#section-6">(🗺️)</a><br>
        </li>
        <li>They can be used in filesystem paths and JSON <span class="citation" data-cites="ecma_ecma-404_2017">(<a
              href="#ref-ecma_ecma-404_2017" role="doc-biblioref">ECMA

        <li>They are fun and pretty</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are also reasons why emoji are bad, primarily
        compatibility, manageability, maintainability, and security
        :</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Not all applications can view emoji correctly <a href="#section-40">(🧤)</a></li>
        <li>It can be difficult to maintain and manage emoji mappings to
          ideas over time. <a href="#section-42">(🎛️)</a> <a href="#section-41">(🔧)</a></li>
        <li>Invisible elements and alternative visualizations can cause
          security issues. <a href="#section-46">(🔒️)</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Long-form text is usually not immediately understood. For
        many people, only the first couple of sentences is read in a
        long narrative. Emoji have quite a few quirks that make them
        difficult to use in knowledge systems; however, from a human
        perspective it makes understanding systems at rest and in motion
        much easier. The priority of <span
