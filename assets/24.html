      <p>
        This is an odd way to finish a design, as there is much work to
        do to create a SPA that works. Further, the analysis is part of
        the design itself. Resilience requires flexibility in the
        beginning, which is both why this works so well, but also why
        the lines are blurred between analysis, design, and engineering.
        Consider pushing dev tasks onto your system analyst rather than
        vice versa. Directly involve stakeholders in defining the
        schema. It is similar to the early days of personal computers.
        Non-technical people assumed they would weave applications
        together with code, either collaboratively as part of the sale,
        or as training. Think of these components in that sense, as
        though they are bits of BASIC code that integrates the data.
        Establish the situation with the schema at the same time you are
        considering the compute to render the visualizations. The
        visualization will play back into the schema design. These are
        flexible, complimentary tasks that iteratively improve each
        other, yet at the same time, they aren’t that heavy. JavaScript
        is a bit of a jump for many, but I have included standard
        features in the design, that can be used to build out new
        solutions. Even better, I have implemented this design with
        eleven demonstration SPAs in <a href="#section-61">(📺)</a> that
        should help imagine models for a variety of different scenarios.
        Once you are solid on creating SPAs that provide near real-time
        visualization and collaboration, these can extend to streams and
