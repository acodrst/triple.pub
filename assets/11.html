      <p>
        During collaboration, there should be minimal limitations on who
        can contribute.<a href="#section-25">(👥)</a> If any participant
        feels something is wrong with the system map being built
        collaboratively, it should be easy to capture. Likewise, if a
        particular proposition (triple) is verified by an agreed expert,
        then that should also be easy to capture. <a href="#section-26">(🛂)</a> Focusing on the core knowledge
        first, rather than code, platform, frameworks or metal,
        facilitates collaboration from the start. Further, a focus on
        decomposed knowledge, coupled with immediate visualization,
        makes meetings more productive, since there is little delay
        between gathering knowledge and the visualized model. Decomposed
        knowledge streams (triples) only require a “lock” or merge on
        the triple itself <span class="citation" data-cites="kleppmann_local-first_2019">(<a

            role="doc-biblioref">Shapiro et al., </a>)</span>. It is less
        likely that during collaboration one person will step on
        another, e.g., one person might change the title while somebody
        else is editing the description. The big win for collaboration
        is on multi-level data flow diagrams (DFDs), as different areas
        of expertise can collaborate concurrently to build the
        models.</p>
      <h3 id="section-26">🛂 Validate</h3>
      <p>
        As the model is built, we should be able to agree and document
        validation. If we are modeling a system with a database, and
        need to understand failover procedures, who validates that
        information? <a href="#section-13">(📛)</a> Triples facilitate
        this by providing a mechanism to detail what an aspect means,
        and what the aspects used to describe those aspects mean. If a
        failover procedure to provide availability requires particular
        staff, this can be added. A famous example from when many
        businesses used on-premises database clusters, is failing back a
        failed database to ensure it can fail again, if it wasn’t
        possible or convenient to automate. Even if it is convenient,
        who verifies that the process works? Who verifies it when
        storage is changed? The design might specify active/passive
        failover to meet the availability requirements, but there is
        another entire graph of aspects that can be added on and changed
        easily about the details, without losing the original effort. If
        the CIO validated the triple “availability must_be 99.999”, then
        this implies 24/7 DBA staff that understand how to failover the
        database, orchestration with the storage team, contracts for
        storage, server, and software maintenance, and even HR
        relationships. None of this contradicts the original triple of
        availability that the CIO validated. Building these kinds of
        open structures work for more than just IT. It provides both
        elemental facts (atoms), but collaborative ways to build real
        meaning and validation and avoid erroneous conclusions, like “we
        are running at 99.999 availability because the CIO validated it”

      <h3 id="section-27">📒 Accountable</h3>
      <p>
        Participation often requires accountability. If I analyze a
        system, I am accountable for my work. Likewise, others who
        participate should be held accountable for their efforts. This
        is in a different direction than who validates. I might be
        responsible for determining who validates the database failover
        procedures. I then document them and get somebody to validate
        it. This also requires identity. <a href="#section-13">(📛)</a></p>
      <h3 id="section-28">⚖️ Contribute</h3>
      <p>
        One of the reasons that the Whiteboard and Stickies exercise
        works so well is that everybody can contribute. <a href="#section-1">(📌)</a> Rabbit holes are often revealed
        that
        need to be explored later. While it is true that there are often
        an abundance of ideas, yet few are actionable, triples allow
        these to exist with a minimum of meeting derailment. For
        instance, “One time five years ago we were down for three days
        because Mary left, and we never got another DBA with storage
        experience,” is a perfectly good collection of triples. (Mary
        was DBA, Mary had storage experience, We were down five years
        ago. The incident five years ago lasted three days. The incident
        could have been resolved if the current DBA had storage
        experience.) If, upon investigation, it is realized that the
        real reason the database was down was that the firmware on the
        storage array was upgraded, the rest of the triples are still
        valid. At the same time, the only thing that needs to take place
        in the meeting is a sticky note on the whiteboard that says
        “Fred: One time five years ago we were down for three days
        because Mary left, and we never got another DBA with storage
        experience”. The same exact note can be put down to be moved to
        triples later, matched against the appropriate knowledge graph,
        or visualized immediately by utilizing the tools described in
        this paper. <span
