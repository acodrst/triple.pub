      <p>
        My main motivation with this paper is to capture a vision I
        developed over the last decade about how analysis and systems,
        both IT and the biosphere, can benefit by the concept of
        triples. I donâ€™t pretend that I understand more than 10 percent
        of Charles Peirce, nor heavy semiotics. I donâ€™t pretend that Iâ€™m
        an academic, but I have borrowed some of the techniques for this
        presentation. My approach is more outsider art than a proper
        thesis <span class="citation" data-cites="mcdonald_interview_2020">(<a href="#ref-mcdonald_interview_2020"
            role="doc-biblioref">McDonald 2020</a>)</span>. If I had to do
        it all over again, I <strong>still</strong> wouldnâ€™t pursue a
        higher degree than my generic math undergraduate degree. I value
        those that do follow the academic paths, particularly those that
        strive to share knowledge in their career, rather than cashing
        in. I have traced many academics in the space Iâ€™m interested in,
        where they were all open about their ideas, and then BOOM,
        everything is closed off and they have a product with IP to
        protect. I imagine Iâ€™ve probably committed a few academic sins
        in this work. The references are related, but sometimes in
        exactly the opposite way as context. I also include tangential
        references, either much broader than context, or only including
        a small piece. I am doing this in good faith, but please treat
        this as outsider art rather than following established norms.
        This is the best way I could come up with to share the vision I
        have about this topic, and provide a working example of the
        ideas. Fig. 40 was my attempt a few years ago at putting all of

        into a single page. My idea was that symbolic links on a file
        system could connect the leaves of a taxonomy, and form a graph
        that could be processed with Graphviz to create a visualization
        <span class="citation" data-cites="graphviz_graphviz_2023">(<a href="#ref-graphviz_graphviz_2023"
            role="doc-biblioref">Graphviz
            2023</a>)</span>. Text associated with the leaves could add
        detail. I even included a SPARQL query to do inference on the
        triples using a formal ontology, but it would require processing
        the tree to create triples and inserting into Virtuoso <span class="citation" data-cites="w3c_sparql_2013">(<a

        people to imagine how the ideas were useful. It also required
        quite a few pieces. One advantage of this method is that the
        trees can be checked in with git. I ended up going with emoji
        triples, though, in the end, and arrived at <span

        Triples in text form can also be checked in. Iâ€™d say Fig. 40
        qualifies as outsider art.
