        The number of relations in this example is an edge case of how
        large a system <span

        can handle with human cognition limits, but it might be helpful
        for understanding how the <a href="#section-47">design</a>
        works. The Internet and related technology is heavily steeped in
        graphs. This example uses DNS and WWW/HTML graphs. It is meant
        for a network engineer, not a layperson. First, let’s use 🏷️ to
        label some nodes.</p>
      <p>🛰🔹🏷️🔹Internet<br>
        🛰🔸🦷🔹🏷️🔹Top level domain (TLD)<br>
        🛰🔸🍕🔹🏷️🔹Second level domain (2LD)<br>

      <p>The English for the third line is “The Internet the concept
        of a Second level domain (2LD), which we will symbolize by 🍕.”
        Did I pick 🕴️, because it is Peter Tosh? Most certainly. Peter
        Tosh is our host in this schema. <span class="citation" data-cites="veix_secret_2016">(<a
            href="#ref-veix_secret_2016" role="doc-biblioref">Veix 2016</a>)</span> <span class="citation"

      <h3 id="section-84">🔠 ASCII</h3>
      <p>
        Using ASCII as triples is also fine:</p>
      <p>net ^ lbl ^ Internet<br>
        net ~ TLD ^ lbl ^ Top level domain (TLD)<br>
        net ~ 2LD ^ lbl ^ Second level domain (2LD)<br>
        net ~ hst ^ lbl ^ Host<br>
        net ~ IPV4 ^ lbl ^ IPV4 Address<br>
        net ~ IPV6 ^ lbl ^ IPV6 Address<br>
        net ~ TCP ^ lbl ^ TCP Port<br>
        net ~ TCP ~ 443 ^ lbl ^ HTTPS (website)</p>
      <p>It is my take that emoji facilitate human cognition in the
        above example, but human cognition often comes at a cost of
        scaling, primarily because of machine cognition. <a href="#section-38">(🐡)</a> Some people find icons more
        difficult to follow than text. The priority of <span
          style="height:1em;width:2em;top:.3em;position:relative; display:inline-flex;align-self:center;"><svg

        is human cognition, not machine cognition, so whatever works
        better for your group wins. I am doubling down in emoji in this
        document, but if ASCII is better for you, go for it.</p>
      <h3 id="section-85">👫 Mary and Bruce</h3>
      <p>
        Mary might put up a collection of recipes at a domain called
        marysfavs.recipes. Bruce might have another recipe domain that
        they post to called bruz.hotsauce. Say that Bruce likes a recipe
        Mary has. They could place a link to the recipe on their
        bruz.hotsauce domain favorites page without Mary doing a thing.
        Meanwhile there could be a university somewhere that is
        categorizing all hot sauces. Bruce might be able to use that,
        but they don’t have to. We can and will borrow from the magic of
        the World Wide Web, and bring it back to the web browser where
        it lives quite well.</p>
      <h3 id="section-86">🎡 Graph</h3>
      <p>
        A graph is a container for the system under analysis, much like
        Bruce’s burningbruzfoods.hotsauce domain. Pages, labels, images,
        dates, and links all work within the graph. It is not required;
        however, if you intend to integrate with other graphs, the graph
        needs to be unique, much like how if Bruce was only creating
        recipes for themselves, they could ignore
        burningbruzfoods.hotsauce references.</p>
      <h3 id="section-87">🏊️ Deeper</h3>
      <p>
        Let’s work with the emoji version, and set up some 🦷, 🍕,
        and🕴️.</p>

        🛰🔸🦷🔸recipes🔸🍕🔸marysfavs🔹📛🔹93.184.216.34<br>
        🛰🔸🦷🔸recipes🔸🍕🔸marysfavs🔹🧑🔹Mary Jenkins<br>
        🛰🔸🦷🔸hotsauce🔸🍕🔸bruz🔹🧑🔹Bruce Smith<br>
        🛰🔸🦷🔸hotsauce🔸🍕🔸bruz🔹🕴️🔹www<br>
        🛰🔸🦷🔸recipes🔸🍕🔸marysfavs🔹🕴️🔹www</p>
      <p>The above triples tell us the TLD, 2LD, IP addresses, Domain
        Owners, and hosts. Notice that I am assigning an IP address to a
        2LD, even though I have another node that is a host. This
        illustrates the mixed support of using a 2LD as a host. It is a
        bit off from a graph perspective.</p>
      <p>Notice that this is hierarchical, following DNS.</p>
      <p>🛰🔸🦷🔸recipes🔸🍕🔸marysfavs🔹🕴️🔹www:</p>
      <p>We have a TLD (🦷) of recipes, a 2LD 🍕 of marysfavs, and a
        hostname (🕴️) of www, i.e. www.recipes.marysfavs.</p>
      <p>I could enter IP addresses for the hosts, and even TCP 443 w/
        HTTPS:</p>
      <p>🛰🔸🦷🔸hotsauce🔸🍕🔸bruz🔸🕴️🔸www🔹📛🔹93.184.216.34<br>
        🛰🔸🦷🔸hotsauce🔸🍕🔸bruz🔸🕴️🔸www🔸📛🔸93.184.216.34🔹 🔌
        🔹🌐</p>
      <p>The convention I’m using is a pair for each node. The first
        of the pair is the class, and the second forms the ID. This
        means that the node is unique via the path, the stuff delimited
        by 🔸. I don’t always do this. 🌐 is a specific instance of 🔌,
        and 🛰 is the root graph designation.</p>
      <p>I am crossing/conflating “domains” from a graph sense. There
        are multiple things going on, here. The IP address is part of
        its own hierarchy/graph based on networking. I am merging the
        namespace for the internet with physical aspects. DNS crosses
        graph domains, going from a taxonomy to OSI layer 3 and 4.</p>
      <p>I’m still not at “a href”, which is a third domain of HTML.
        To get there, I need to add some new node types:</p>
      <p>🛰🔸📑🔹🏷️🔹Index<br>
        🛰🔸📓🔹🏷️🔹Page<br>
        🛰🔸✒️🔹🏷️🔹Entry<br>
        🛰🔸🔗🔹🏷️🔹A HREF hypertext reference</p>
      <p>Mary’s website, with the front page listing other pages for
        dinners and lunches, has a recipe for Crispy Eel on the lunches
        Dinners page:</p>
      <p>🛰🔸🦷🔸recipes🔸🍕🔸marysfavs🔸🕴️🔸www🔸📑🔸📓🔸1🔹🏷️🔹Dinners<br>
        🛰🔸🦷🔸recipes🔸🍕🔸marysfavs🔸🕴️🔸www🔹📑🔹📓🔸1<br>
        🛰🔸🦷🔸recipes🔸🍕🔸marysfavs🔸🕴️🔸www🔹📑🔹📓🔸2<br>
        🛰🔸🦷🔸recipes🔸🍕🔸marysfavs🔸🕴️🔸www🔸📑🔸📓🔸2🔹🏷️🔹Lunches<br>
        🛰🔸🦷🔸recipes🔸🍕🔸marysfavs🔸🕴️🔸www🔸📑🔸📓🔸1🔸✒️🔸31🔹🏷️🔹Crispy
        Eel</p>
      <p>Notice how these are listed out of order? This triple is a
        path to the Dinner section and a label:<br>
        🛰🔸🦷🔸recipes🔸🍕🔸marysfavs🔸🕴️🔸www🔸📑🔸📓🔸1🔹🏷️🔹Dinners</p>
      <p>It is above:<br>
        🛰🔸🦷🔸recipes🔸🍕🔸marysfavs🔸🕴️🔸www🔹📑🔹📓🔸1.</p>
      <p>We haven’t defined other things, like the title of the index
        page for the website, that might well be different than the host
        or domain name. We don’t even have to know what 📑 even means to
        know that whoever is writing up this schema asserts that the
        label for the node:<br>
        🛰🔸🦷🔸recipes🔸🍕🔸marysfavs🔸🕴️🔸www🔸📑🔸📓🔸1<br>
        is Dinners. This is one of the magical things about triples. It
        works on the open world assumption. This helps with
        collaboration. <a href="#section-25">(👥)</a> As long as
        everybody agrees on the general schema, the entire system can
        come together asynchronously. Knowledge arises from the
        collaboration, rather than needing a lot of up-front work. <a href="#section-21">(🌳)</a> In this case, a
        bunch of information
        about the dinners and lunches on the site could be done by
        somebody with zero knowledge of IP addresses and domain name
        resolution. This can be rolled in with other information. Even
        if bits of 🦷🔸recipes🔸🍕🔸marysfavs🔸🕴️🔸www change, it is
        relatively easy to plug existing work into a new schema. <a href="#section-20">(⚛️)</a> On to 🔗!!</p>
      <p>Here is Bruce’s website:</p>
      <p>🛰🔸🦷🔸hotsauce🔸🍕🔸bruz🔸🕴️🔸www🔸📑🔸📓🔸1🔹🏷️🔹Favorite
        Links<br>
        🛰🔸🦷🔸hotsauce🔸🍕🔸bruz🔸🕴️🔸www🔹📑🔹📓🔸1<br>

        🔹🛰🔸🦷🔸recipes🔸🍕🔸marysfavs🔸🕴️🔸www🔸📑🔸📓🔸1🔸✒️🔸31</p>
      <p>Note that we added a convention of ↩︎️ to mean the triple is
        split up between lines. That is a completely arbitrary choice,
        but visually it seems to be fine. We got there. We have a model
        of a website on the internet, which, at this point in human
        history for many, is considered everything.</p>
