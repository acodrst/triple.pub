      <p>
        Whether we are looking at a road map or a diagram of arteries
        and veins in the human body, maps are one of the main ways that
        we understand something. They serve as a guide to the as-is, and
        as a cognitive exoskeleton to build new knowledge.</p>

      <p>Along with casting and the imagination and technique of the
        director, a screenplay is used to create a movie. A screenplay
        is a re-usable document that helps humans cognitively understand
        the movie enough to participate. It captures just enough
        knowledge to express the ideas as a movie. A screenplay does
        this by working within established meaning and conventions. It
        is possible to insert scenes and modify characters easily.
        Consider Fig. 10, the 1939 movie <strong><em>Made for Each
            Other</em></strong>, now in the public domain <span class="citation"
          data-cites="david_o_selznick_made_1939">(<a href="#ref-david_o_selznick_made_1939" role="doc-biblioref">David
            O. Selznick 1939</a>)</span>. AI/ML
        and business intelligence tools running against the finished
        movie, metaphor or literal, can identify the actors and items in
        various scenes. They can categorize the props to recreate the
        scene with other actors superimposed. They can trace the flow of
        the movie against theater and consumer behavior data to predict
        the amount of popcorn that viewers decide to skip out and buy
        during the scene. Much of the knowledge, though, is not
        recoverable from the surface movie with AI/ML. It is quite
        likely that the pauses, awkward moments, and humor will be lost,
        like when Carole Lombard glances at James Stewart. We lose the
        original intent and the beauty of the way that the director,
        actors, and crew created the movie from the screenplay map. This
        gets at the human interest and effort underneath the stream. <a href="#section-24">(üí†)</a> Humans need more
        than just
        monetizing, parsing, and predicting streams. As stakeholders in
        the systems that we rely on, what is our equivalent
        screenplay?</p>
