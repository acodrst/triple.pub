        ‚Ä¶ or, how I got the Triple System Analysis bug, and lived to
        tell about it.</p>
      <h2 id="section-74">üç∫ Homebrew Computer</h2>
      <p>
        My interest in maps started with my computing hobby. I purchased
        a MicroAce kit in 1980 <span class="citation" data-cites="microace_ad_1980">(<a href="#ref-microace_ad_1980"
            role="doc-biblioref">MicroAce 1980</a>)</span>. I wasn‚Äôt
        satisified. I wanted to know how a computer worked deeper than
        just entering BASIC, so I decided to build one myself. I
        completed the first breadboard version of a Z-80 homebrew that
        same year, in 1980. It failed miserably. I didn‚Äôt understand the
        concept of a high-impedance state for the bus, and I thought my
        construction technique was creating too much noise. I worked on
        and off for many years, breadboarding different versions. With
        the ups and downs in my life, it took awhile to finish. I would
        go for years at a time without working on it, but I finally
        completed a working, soldered system in 1992.</p>

      <p>The display in the upper right of Fig. 30 I soldered first,
        in 1989. I‚Äôm using old 25 pair telco wire. The insulation melted
        and caused shorts, but I chose it because I owned some at the
        time. The lower right board that is connected to the bottom of
        the case holds 2N2222 drivers for lamps, which you can see in
        Fig. 31, which shows me toggling reset. Right after reset, the
        lamps in the center, to the right, show the streaming data the
        homebrew is receiving over a PC parallel port. This is a small
        bootstrap program that looks for a byte on the parallel port
        with the correct signal line state, loads it into memory, waits
        for another state change, loads that byte into memory, repeats
        until all bytes are loaded, and, finally, jumps back to run the
        program, which cycles the incandescent lamps and the 7-segment
        displays <span class="citation" data-cites="triple_pub_my_2023">(<a href="#ref-triple_pub_my_2023"
            role="doc-biblioref">Triple Pub
            2023b</a>)</span>. A bootstrap is usually entered through rows
        of switches and lights called a front panel. I couldn‚Äôt afford a
        proper front panel, so I used dipswitches and a paperclip
        interface with NAND gates in a set/reset configuration to
        debounce and enter data. Fig. 32 is what I used to program the
        bootstrap directly into memory.</p>

      <p>The NAND gates are in the electrical tape wrapped handle of
        the perfboard. You can see the binary-decimal conversion for the
        bit locations written in between the paperclips sticking out. As
        I moved the homebrew around, following jobs and apartments, the
        solder connections would break, mainly because of bad soldering
        on my part, in combination with the technical debt of choosing
        point-to-point solder on perfboard, as shown in Fig. 33. I
        needed a way to document it, and a schematic which doubled as a
        physical diagram of the pinouts was the most effective reference
        for troubleshooting. When I first breadboarded this, I started
        with the hand-drawn diagram in Fig. 34.</p>

      <p>I spent quite a few staycations looking at something like
        Fig. 36 My hand drawn version worked OK, but I realized that
        legible hand-drawn lines would be difficult to manage, and
        finishing the hand-drawn version would likely end in failure. I
        tried a variety of diagram programs, but the only one that
        worked for what I needed, that didn‚Äôt cost too much, was Xfig,
        which I used to create Fig. 35. Xfig only ran on *NIX systems,
        and was my early motivation to learn GNU/Linux <span class="citation" data-cites="noauthor_xfig_2021">(<a

        like a graph, where the edge is a wire connecting the nodes of
        two connections. Or alternatively, a schematic is a wiring map.
        The intention is to create a solder joint that won‚Äôt break, but
        the reality is that they do, and having a map of pinouts and
        wires goes miles towards keeping the homebrew running. My map
        distinguished control lines from address and bus with color
        coding, and curved the lines so they were distinguishable from
        each other. <span class="citation" data-cites="triple_pub_homebrew_2023">(<a
